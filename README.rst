Overview
--------

This module implements cuberille implicit surface polygonization for `ITK
<https://www.itk.org>`_. This method operates by dividing the surface into a
number of small cubes called cuberilles. Each cuberille is centered at a pixel
lying on the iso-surface and then quadrilaterals are generated for each face.
The original approach is improved by projecting the vertices of each cuberille
onto the implicit surface, smoothing the typical block-like resultant mesh.
